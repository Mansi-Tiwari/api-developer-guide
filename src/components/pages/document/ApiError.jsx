                If you exceed the rate limit for the API, you will receive a{" "}

                the rate limit restrictions and adjust your request frequency
                accordingly rate limit is 15min. If you receive this error,
                please wait for the specified time window to elapse before
                making additional requests.

                It's important to handle these errors appropriately in your
